1. Challenges Faced:
During the exam, one of the main challenges I faced was structuring the Messaging Management System and ensuring the program correctly handled adding and removing messages. I also struggled with debugging certain parts of the code where errors would appear unexpectedly. To resolve these challenges, I reviewed my code logic, tested individual functions and used online resources help me fix the issues effectively.

2. AI Tool Usage:
AI tools were quite helpful in providing guidance during the exam, especially in writing the ms.md document and helping with compiling Java code. Whenever I faced issues with compiling or encountered errors, I turned to AI for quick suggestions on how to resolve them. The AI was particularly useful for suggesting error fixes and optimizing the way I structured some of the functions. Even this was mainly written by AI and then edited by me

3. Cases with No Desired Result:
There were a few instances where I expected AI to help more with optimizing the logic of certain complex tasks, but the suggested solutions didnâ€™t always fit perfectly with my vision. In most cases I wanted to stick to the regular Java but the logic AI was providing was a bit complex for my udnerstanding, since this is my first time working with Java. I was not confident in using the code provided without fully understanding it yet so I had to stick to my code.
